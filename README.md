# CARS
Competitive Adaptive Reweighted Sampling for feature selection

This repository provides a Python implementation of **Competitive Adaptive Reweighted Sampling (CARS)** for feature selection using **Partial Least Squares Regression (PLS-R)**.

## Usage

```python
import cars

# X: numpy array with features
# y: numpy array with the response
selected_features = cars(X, y, n_iterations=100, ncomp=30, V=True)

X = X[:,selected_features] # subset selected features
```
